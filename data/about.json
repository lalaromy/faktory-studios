  "paragraph1": "Faktory Studios is the one-stop enterprise where one can discover that the production process was never as enjoyable as it is now - the design, sourcing, manufacturing and shipping as four phases we take care of the full process, letting the client focus on other parts of a fashion business. With the lowest minimum quantities, one can find on the market, we offer our clients an ability to react quickly on the market needs or trying new product styles, without risking ending up with too much left-over stock.",
  "paragraph2": "Within Faktory Studios, we have two branches: FAKTORY LABORATORIO that deals with production for Serbian brands/ designers only, and FAKTORY TISSUS, that is dedicated to distributing high-quality fabrics made in France and Italy. Our team consists of highly qualified staff, and the company is solely comprised of inspiring women. Faktory is dedicated to empowering Serbian women, continuously working on improving their skills and providing well paid full-time jobs. Our employees are our strength, and FAKTORY STUDIOS would not be what it is right this moment if it wasnâ€™t for them.",
  "paragraph3": "The entire production is being done in-house, as well as the embroidery and printing service. That gives us the luxury of overseeing each stitch and every garment made under our roof fully as the garments go through rigorous quality control. Therefore, our production is high quality, and requires no minimum order quantity (MOQ)!"
